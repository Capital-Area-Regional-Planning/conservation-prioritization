This pilot project uses historical aerial photography and satellite imagery to track forest change from 1937 to 2022. 
Forest change data was hand-delineated in a small study area in Wisconsin. Funding was provided by the Bock Foundation.

An R Shiny app lets users view an interactive map and graphical summary of the data.
